## Installation

1. Open VSCode.
2. Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
3. Search for `Laravel Artisan Helper` and click `Install` to install the extension.

## Usage

### Activating the Extension

The extension is activated automatically when you open a Laravel project that contains the `artisan` file in its root directory. If your project is not a Laravel project, you will receive a warning message.

### Accessing Laravel Commands

Once activated, you will see a new "Laravel Tools" icon in the Activity Bar. Click on it to access various Laravel commands categorized into:

- **Make**: Commands for creating new Laravel components such as controllers, models, migrations, and more.
- **Migrate & Database**: Commands for managing database migrations and seeding.
- **Misc**: Miscellaneous Laravel commands like serving the application and listing routes.

### Running Artisan Commands

1. Click on the desired command in the sidebar.
2. If the command requires input (e.g., the name of a new controller), you will be prompted to enter the required information.
3. The command will be executed in the integrated terminal, and you can view the output directly in VSCode.

### Viewing Route List

1. Click on the "route:list" command under the Misc category.
2. A new tab will open displaying a table of registered routes.
3. Use the "Refresh" button to update the route list.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The extension will automatically detect Laravel projects based on the presence of the `artisan` file.
